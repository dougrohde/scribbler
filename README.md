[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/scribbler)

Scribbler is a little utility for simplifying logging across one application or more.
Currently it assists in:

* Dynamically defining methods for accessing the log files
* Centralized log method for file, message, and error checks
  - Currently also able to notify NewRelic, abstraction and extension to come

## Usage

In your Rails project add

    gem 'scribbler'

to your Gemfile and

    bundle install

Then

    scribbler install # For options do `scribbler` first

You'll find your configuration options in `config/initializers/scribbler.rb`.
**Better, more documented examples in the template file provided by `scribbler install`**
As an example, with this configuration file in a Rails app called `Blogger`:

    Scribbler::Base.configure do
      config.application_include = true

      # config.log_directory = File.new '/a/better/path'

      config.logs = %w[production delayed_job]

      config.use_template_by_default = true # Default: false

      # config.template = proc do |options|
      #   <<-MSG
      #   ##########
      #   Cool template bro!
      #   Message: #{options[:message]}
      #   MSG
      # end
    end

You are given a few methods for free. To get the production logfile location:

    Blogger.production_log_location
    # => <#Path: Rails.root.join('log', 'production.log')>

or

    Scribbler::Base.production_log_location
    # => <#Path: Rails.root.join('log', 'production.log')>

More importantly you're given access to a sweet `log` method:

    # Notifies NewRelic and drops the message in log found at Blogger.production_log_location
    Blogger.log :production, :error => e, :message => "#{e} broke stuff"
    Scribbler::Base.log :production, :error => e, :message => "#{e} broke stuff"

    # Only logs to log/delayed_job.log and doesn't notify NewRelic
    Blogger.log :delayed_job, :message => "Successfully executed Delayed Job"
    Scribbler::Base.log :delayed_job, :message => "Successfully executed Delayed Job"

    # Doesn't notify NewRelic but gives the method access to the error and logs the message
    # to the given logfile
    Blogger.log 'production', :new_relic => false, :error => e, :message => "#{e} broke stuff"
    Scribbler::Base.log 'production', :new_relic => false, :error => e, :message => "#{e} broke stuff"

    # Logs to given file without using the fancy log methods
    Blogger.log File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'logfile.log')), :message => "#{e} broke stuff"
    Scribbler::Base.log File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'logfile.log')), :message => "#{e} broke stuff"

Log options with the default template proc:

    options   - Hash of options for logging on Ngin
              :error            - Error object, mostly for passing to NewRelic
              :message          - Message to log in the actual file [REQUIRED]
              :custom_fields    - Custom fields dropped into the default template
              :template         - Whether or not to use the template at this log
              :new_relic        - Notify NewRelic of the error (default: true)

With the template enabled (either during call to log [:template => true] or by setting to
be used by default) you will have each log entry wrapped into a template to pretty-up and
get some more boilerplate data. As you can see in the config above. See method
docs and specs for more information.

## Todo

* Configure the module/class receiving the include
* Configurable notification gem (NewRelic, Airbrake, etc.)
* Currently attempts to notify NewRelic if its there, abstract and allow custom services
* Allow a class to set default options for a log call within itself
* Allow there to be a log made without the option[:message], in case its all custom_fields or someting
* Allow event hooks on log call?
